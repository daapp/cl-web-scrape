cl-web-scrape
=============

A web scraping library in Common Lisp intended to provide the functionality of Beautiful Soup (Python) or Nokogiri (Ruby).

This library provides web scraping functionality used in other projects. It's not intended as a complete web scraping framework that's ready to deploy, but will instead grow as I required new functionaily. This project is highly unstable and changing quickly.

CL-WEB-SCRAPE relies on a native Lisp SEXPR-based document object model (DOM) which can be manipulated either with the DOM accessor protocol provided or with native Lisp list-processing functions.

This library is released under a LLGPL license.
